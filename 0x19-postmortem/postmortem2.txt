Postmortem Report: The "Great jQuery Jumble" Service Outage of November 6, 2023

Issue Summary:
Duration: It was a tense 45 minutes (from 10:00 AM to 10:45 AM UTC) where our beloved web application had a case of stage fright, refusing to show the audience (our users) its repertoire of amenities, states, and cities.

Impact: Picture this â€“ 60% of our users turned up for the grand performance only to find the web app juggling, dropping, and basically mishandling amenities like a clumsy magician. States and cities were also playing a bizarre game of hide-and-seek, creating a user experience that was less "wow" and more "ow."

Root Cause: Deep in the heart of our application, a jQuery script was acting like a rebellious teenager, refusing to bind checkboxes and handle their states with any semblance of responsibility.

Timeline:

10:00 AM (UTC): A user rings the alarm. "Hey, your app's forgetting what I'm clicking on!" The QA team confirms the amnesia is widespread.
10:00-10:30 AM (UTC): Engineers play detective on the wrong street, interrogating backend systems that had nothing to hide.
10:30 AM (UTC): The web development wizards are summoned for a spell of intense code conjuring.
10:45 AM (UTC): Eureka! The mischievous jQuery script is tamed, checkboxes are once again remembering their duties, and order is restored.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes (The "Let's Not Do That Again" List):

Roll out the red carpet for a beefier code review protocol, especially for the JavaScript/jQuery divas.
Implement a time machine (a.k.a. better version control) to pinpoint when and where our code decided to freelance.
Initiate "Operation: jQuery Ninja" to transform our devs into front-end code warriors.
Tasks (The "Homework" Section):

Unleash a legion of code reviewers on our jQuery scripts like a horde of grammar nerds on a misspelled tweet.
Deploy automated testing gremlins to nip any bugs in the bud before they blossom into full-blown feature foes.
Start a "jQuery Jamboree" - a festive exchange of knowledge, best practices, and maybe some cookies.
